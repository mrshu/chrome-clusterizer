chrome-clusterizer
==================

A Chrome extension that takes a look at your tabs, analyzes their contents and divides them into separate windows to keep you more focused.

## Install

The extension is under heavy development at the moment but you can still
install it by downloading the pre-built binary from
[here](https://github.com/mrshu/chrome-clusterizer/blob/master/build/chrome-clusterizer-latest.crx), heading to `chrome://extensions` and dropping the binary there.

## Usage

Click on the popup button, select the minimal amount of clusters you would like
your tabs to be devided into, and then press 'Clusterize!'.
